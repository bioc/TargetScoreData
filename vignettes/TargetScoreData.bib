	Abstract = {Resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have poor prognosis, with 30-50\% relapsing within 5 years. Current staging criteria do not fully capture the complexity of this disease. Survival could be improved by identification of those early-stage patients who are most likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy. Molecular classification by using mRNA expression profiles has led to multiple, poorly overlapping signatures. We hypothesized that differing statistical methodologies contribute to this lack of overlap. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed our previously published quantitative RT-PCR dataset with a semisupervised method. A 6-gene signature was identified and validated in 4 independent public microarray datasets that represent a range of tumor histologies and stages. This result demonstrated that at least 2 prognostic signatures can be derived from this single dataset. We next estimated the total number of prognostic signatures in this dataset with a 10-million-signature permutation study. Our 6-gene signature was among the top 0.02\% of signatures with maximum verifiability, reaffirming its efficacy. Importantly, this analysis identified 1,789 unique signatures, implying that our dataset contains >500,000 verifiable prognostic signatures for NSCLC. This result appears to rationalize the observed lack of overlap among reported NSCLC prognostic signatures.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a statistical model for microarray gene expression data that comprises data calibration, the quantification of differential expression, and the quantification of measurement error. In particular, we derive a transformation h for intensity measurements, and a difference statistic Deltah whose variance is approximately constant along the whole intensity range. This forms a basis for statistical inference from microarray data, and provides a rational data pre-processing strategy for multivariate analyses. For the transformation h, the parametric form h(x)=arsinh(a+bx) is derived from a model of the variance-versus-mean dependence for microarray intensity data, using the method of variance stabilizing transformations. For large intensities, h coincides with the logarithmic transformation, and Deltah with the log-ratio. The parameters of h together with those of the calibration between experiments are estimated with a robust variant of maximum-likelihood estimation. We demonstrate our approach on data sets from different experimental platforms, including two-colour cDNA arrays and a series of Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: When running experiments that involve multiple high density oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations. RESULTS: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably. AVAILABILITY: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

	Abstract = {When we analyze measured values by statistical techniques, we usually use a parametric method. It is necessary for measured values to show a normal distribution. Therefore, we must confirm that the distribution is normal, whereby a histogram shows that the distribution of data points is symmetrical above and below the mean. When measured values do not show a normal distribution, power transformation (square root transformation, logarithmic transformation) must be performed. We can evaluate the presence of normality by three methods: viewing a histogram, through skewness and kurtosis values, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov method's p-value. Because Kolmogorov-Smirnov's method is influenced by outliers, attention is necessary regarding the interpretation of p-values. For example, if we calculate reference intervals from clinical testing data, we calculate a parameter(mean and standard deviation) and set X +/- 2SD to upper and lower limits, respectively. When we evaluate the reference intervals, a range including 95\% of the central part of sample is important. Identification of the distribution type based on the diagonal linear pattern of normal quantile plots may be the most reliable in my experience.},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

Most current methods select genes based on known phenotype information. However, certain set of genes may correspond to new phenotypes which are yet unknown, and it is important to develop novel effective selection methods for their discovery without using any prior phenotype information. RESULTS: We propose and study a new method to select relevant genes based on their similarity information only. The method relies on a mechanism for discarding irrelevant genes. A two-way ordering of gene expression data can force irrelevant genes towards the middle in the ordering and thus can be discarded. Mechanisms based on variance and principal component analysis are also studied. When applied to expression profiles of colon cancer and leukemia, the unsupervised method outperforms the baseline algorithm that simply uses all genes, and it also selects relevant genes close to those selected using supervised methods.

	Abstract = {The presence of carcinoma in situ (CIS) lesions in the urinary bladder is associated with a high risk of disease progression to a muscle invasive stage. In this study, we used microarray expression profiling to examine the gene expression patterns in superficial transitional cell carcinoma (sTCC) with surrounding CIS (13 patients), without surrounding CIS lesions (15 patients), and in muscle invasive carcinomas (mTCC; 13 patients). Hierarchical cluster analysis separated the sTCC samples according to the presence or absence of CIS in the surrounding urothelium. We identified a few gene clusters that contained genes with similar expression levels in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) with surrounding CIS and invasive TCC. However, no close relationship between TCC with adjacent CIS and invasive TCC was observed using hierarchical cluster analysis. Expression profiling of a series of biopsies from normal urothelium and urothelium with CIS lesions from the same urinary bladder revealed that the gene expression found in sTCC with surrounding CIS is found also in CIS biopsies as well as in histologically normal samples adjacent to the CIS lesions. Furthermore, we also identified similar gene expression changes in mTCC samples. We used a supervised learning approach to build a 16-gene molecular CIS classifier. The classifier was able to classify sTCC samples according to the presence or absence of surrounding CIS with a high accuracy. This study demonstrates that a CIS gene expression signature is present not only in CIS biopsies but also in sTCC, mTCC, and, remarkably, in histologically normal urothelium from bladders with CIS. Identification of this expression signature could provide guidance for the selection of therapy and follow-up regimen in patients with early stage bladder cancer.},

The stage of disease at diagnosis and the presence of surrounding carcinoma in situ are important in determining the disease course of an affected individual. Despite considerable effort, no accepted immunohistological or molecular markers have been identified to define clinically relevant subsets of bladder cancer. Here we report the identification of clinically relevant subclasses of bladder carcinoma using expression microarray analysis of 40 well characterized bladder tumors. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified three major stages, Ta, T1 and T2-4, with the Ta tumors further classified into subgroups. We built a 32-gene molecular classifier using a cross-validation approach that was able to classify benign and muscle-invasive tumors with close correlation to pathological staging in an independent test set of 68 tumors. The classifier provided new predictive information on disease progression in Ta tumors compared with conventional staging (P < 0.005). To delineate non-recurring Ta tumors from frequently recurring Ta tumors, we analyzed expression patterns in 31 tumors by applying a supervised learning classification methodology, which classified 75\% of the samples correctly (P < 0.006). Furthermore, gene expression profiles characterizing each stage and subtype identified their biological properties, producing new potential targets for therapy.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: There is a great need to develop analytical methodology to analyze and to exploit the information contained in gene expression data. Because of the large number of genes and the complexity of biological networks, clustering is a useful exploratory technique for analysis of gene expression data. Other classical techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), have also been applied to analyze gene expression data. Using different data analysis techniques and different clustering algorithms to analyze the same data set can lead to very different conclusions. Our goal is to study the effectiveness of principal components (PCs) in capturing cluster structure. Specifically, using both real and synthetic gene expression data sets, we compared the quality of clusters obtained from the original data to the quality of clusters obtained after projecting onto subsets of the principal component axes. RESULTS: Our empirical study showed that clustering with the PCs instead of the original variables does not necessarily improve, and often degrades, cluster quality. In particular, the first few PCs (which contain most of the variation in the data) do not necessarily capture most of the cluster structure. We also showed that clustering with PCs has different impact on different algorithms and different similarity metrics. Overall, we would not recommend PCA before clustering except in special circumstances.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Grouping genes having similar expression patterns is called gene clustering, which has been proved to be a useful tool for extracting underlying biological information of gene expression data. Many clustering procedures have shown success in microarray gene clustering; most of them belong to the family of heuristic clustering algorithms. Model-based algorithms are alternative clustering algorithms, which are based on the assumption that the whole set of microarray data is a finite mixture of a certain type of distributions with different parameters. Application of the model-based algorithms to unsupervised clustering has been reported. Here, for the first time, we demonstrated the use of the model-based algorithm in supervised clustering of microarray data. RESULTS: We applied the proposed methods to real gene expression data and simulated data. We showed that the supervised model-based algorithm is superior over the unsupervised method and the support vector machines (SVM) method. AVAILABILITY: The program written in the SAS language implementing methods I-III in this report is available upon request.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Development of high-throughput technology makes it possible to measure expressions of thousands of genes simultaneously. Genes have the inherent pathway structure, where pathways are composed of multiple genes with coordinated biological functions. It is of great interest to identify differential gene pathways that are associated with the variations of phenotypes. RESULTS: We propose the following approach for detecting differential gene pathways. First, we construct gene pathways using databases such as KEGG or GO. Second, for each pathway, we extract a small number of representative features, which are linear combinations of gene expressions and/or their transformations. Specifically, we propose using (i) principal components (PCs) of gene expression sets, (ii) PCs of expanded gene expression sets and (iii) expanded sets of PCs of gene expressions, as the representative features. Third, we identify differential gene pathways as those with representative features significantly associated with the variations of phenotypes, particularly disease clinical outcomes, in regression models. The false discovery rate approach is used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Analysis of three gene expression datasets suggests that (i) the proposed approach can effectively identify differential gene pathways; (ii) PCs that explain only a small amount of variations of gene expressions may bear significant associations between gene pathways and phenotypes; (iii) including second-order terms of gene expressions may lead to identification of new differential gene pathways; (iv) the proposed approach is relatively insensitive to additional noises; and (v) the proposed approach can identify gene pathways missed by alternative approaches.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identifying patterns of co-expression in microarray data by cluster analysis has been a productive approach to uncovering molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes under investigation. Using experimental replicates can generally improve the precision of the cluster analysis by reducing the experimental variability of measurements. In such situations, Bayesian mixtures allow for an efficient use of information by precisely modeling between-replicates variability. RESULTS: We developed different variants of Bayesian mixture based clustering procedures for clustering gene expression data with experimental replicates. In this approach, the statistical distribution of microarray data is described by a Bayesian mixture model. Clusters of co-expressed genes are created from the posterior distribution of clusterings, which is estimated by a Gibbs sampler. We define infinite and finite Bayesian mixture models with different between-replicates variance structures and investigate their utility by analyzing synthetic and the real-world datasets. Results of our analyses demonstrate that (1) improvements in precision achieved by performing only two experimental replicates can be dramatic when the between-replicates variability is high, (2) precise modeling of intra-gene variability is important for accurate identification of co-expressed genes and (3) the infinite mixture model with the 'elliptical' between-replicates variance structure performed overall better than any other method tested. We also introduce a heuristic modification to the Gibbs sampler based on the 'reverse annealing' principle. This modification effectively overcomes the tendency of the Gibbs sampler to converge to different modes of the posterior distribution when started from different initial positions. Finally, we demonstrate that the Bayesian infinite mixture model with 'elliptical' variance structure is capable of identifying the underlying structure of the data without knowing the 'correct' number of clusters.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: In recent years, work has been carried out on clustering gene expression microarray data. Some approaches are developed from an algorithmic viewpoint whereas others are developed via the application of mixture models. In this article, a family of eight mixture models which utilizes the factor analysis covariance structure is extended to 12 models and applied to gene expression microarray data. This modelling approach builds on previous work by introducing a modified factor analysis covariance structure, leading to a family of 12 mixture models, including parsimonious models. This family of models allows for the modelling of the correlation between gene expression levels even when the number of samples is small. Parameter estimation is carried out using a variant of the expectation-maximization algorithm and model selection is achieved using the Bayesian information criterion. This expanded family of Gaussian mixture models, known as the expanded parsimonious Gaussian mixture model (EPGMM) family, is then applied to two well-known gene expression data sets. RESULTS: The performance of the EPGMM family of models is quantified using the adjusted Rand index. This family of models gives very good performance, relative to existing popular clustering techniques, when applied to real gene expression microarray data.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: In microarray experiments, missing entries arise from blemishes on the chips. In large-scale studies, virtually every chip contains some missing entries and more than 90\% of the genes are affected. Many analysis methods require a full set of data. Either those genes with missing entries are excluded, or the missing entries are filled with estimates prior to the analyses. This study compares methods of missing value estimation. RESULTS: Two evaluation metrics of imputation accuracy are employed. First, the root mean squared error measures the difference between the true values and the imputed values. Second, the number of mis-clustered genes measures the difference between clustering with true values and that with imputed values; it examines the bias introduced by imputation to clustering. The Gaussian mixture clustering with model averaging imputation is superior to all other imputation methods, according to both evaluation metrics, on both time-series (correlated) and non-time series (uncorrelated) data sets.},
